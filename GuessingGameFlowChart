# Step By Step
- **Start:** Starts Program
- **Generate Random Number:** Seperate Program Generates Random Program for User to Guess
- **User Guess**: User guesses the number
- **Is Numeric**: Is the number numeric
    - If yes goes to the next step
    - If no goes back to guess again
- **Guess is low?**: assuming guess is numeric asks if the number is now
    - If yes goes back to start to guess again after saying "too small"
    - If no goes to the next step
- **Is it to big?**: After passing the last step checks if number is to big
    - If yes goes back to guess again after saying "too big"
    - If no goes to the win screen
- **YOU WIN!!!**: YOU WIN
