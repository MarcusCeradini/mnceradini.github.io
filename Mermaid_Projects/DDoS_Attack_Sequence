    Attacker->>+Control Server: Attacker send multipule (hundreds to thousands) attack bots into the control server
    Attacker->>+Attackbot: After breach, attacker releases "attack" signal to cause attackbot to repeatedly sending requests to server
    Attackbot-->>+ Webserver: Starts sending requests after "attack" signal is received
    Webserver-->>-Control Server: Too many request coming in to process, blocks traffic from control server
