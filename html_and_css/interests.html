        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>Scuba Diving: I am a certified scuba diver. During the spring and summer when the water is the perfect temperature
            I enjoy scubadiving with my family. To me it is very satisfying
        </ul>
        <ul>Video Games: I enjoy playing games by myself and with others. Some of the friends I've know for years have come from
            video games. It's also a way to keep in touch with friends I don't see anymore.
        </ul>
        <ul>Reading: I read many different types of books from chatpter books which are all works to mangas that are all pictures.
                     Along with music, it acts as a way to relax and leave reality for a little
        </ul>
        <ul>Travaling with family: Mainly during the summer, but sometimes not, me and my family go on trips around the world.
            We've traveled everywhere from califorina to Italy
        </ul>
        <ul>Riding around on my E wheel: For those who don't know E wheel stands for electric unicycle. I enjoy riding around my 
            area on it while listening to music. I often get glances as I ride but I don't really care.
        </ul>
