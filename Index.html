          <p>Hi, my name is Marcus Ceradini. I am a student at both Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies and Wake Tech Community College.
          I am currently hired at <i><a class = "hover" href = "https://www.mathnasium.com/">Mathnasium</a></i> as a tutor for students like me who have had a hard time with math. 
          I am working to get my associates in computer programming. Outside of school I like to spend time with my family and play video games with some friends. 
          With my family I like to go exploring with and finding new things. While playing with my friends online, I
          like to just hang out and play around with the many games we play.
          <br>
          <br>
          After I graduate with my associates with my associates, I would like to go to a university for 4 years to get my masters.
          I want to go to NC State to spend those 4 years due to it being in a fimiliar area and their technology programs being
          held in a higher regard than other colleges. During that time I would also enjoy getting a better paying job than I have now to help pay for college,
          not putting a lot of pressure on my parents and giving me more experience in work life.
          <br>
          <br>
          After I graduate I am planning to look for a well paying job where I can put my degrees to good use. I would also like to
          be able to get atleast a town house in this area to stay close to my family and lots of developing businesses that in the future
          could have really advance technologies and are in need of new employees. Along with the residence I would also like to start a family
          and once I get to the age of 60 I would like to retire with a decent amount of money from a my savings account to sustain myself and my family for the rest of my days.
